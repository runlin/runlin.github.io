## About Me

My name is Runsheng Lin. This is my [github webpage](https://github.com/runlin/runlin.github.io/edit/master/index.md) (or called profolio for this class). I am a senior student majoring in Statistics and Economics at University of California, Davis. I am extremely interested in quantitative finance, and am currently applying for graduate school with a concentration in financial engineering. [Add one past project here and knowledge/experience gained]. I have two yearsâ€™ experience studying computer science, and therefore I am proficient with R, C++, Java, and Excel. In the future, I am interested in pursuing a quantitative analyst position in the financial industry.

### STA141B

I took this class from UCD. This website is also used to fulfil part of the requirement in the class. This class is new. Here are the summary of course contents:

*This course focuses on fundamental concepts of data technologies that are widely used in data analysis. Students will work with the important technologies used to manage and access data both from traditional databases and Web APIs. They will learn to publish results in rich, interactive visualizations via modern Web technologies. Students are introduced to the important ideas of text mining and natural language processing and how to analyze textual data. The course also explores how to develop statistical software and tools for project management and reproducibility. We emphasize the rich ideas underlying these topics, along with gaining practical experience and reasoning about when to use the different technologies. Students will develop an understanding of the important data technologies, how to use these for data analysis, and how to learn about new technologies as they emerge. Understanding the key concepts of existing important technologies gives students the necessary foundation for life-long self-learning of emerging technologies.*

### Python Final Project

We are required to do a final project to fulfil the last requirement from the class. You can reach the analysis report through this [site](https://runlin.github.io/runsheng_final_project.html).
