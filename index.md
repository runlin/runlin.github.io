## About Me

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/runlin/runlin.github.io/edit/master/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

My name is Runsheng Lin, and I am a senior student majoring in Statistics and Economics at University of California, Davis. I am extremely interested in quantitative finance, and am currently applying for graduate school with a concentration in financial engineering. [Add one past project here and knowledge/experience gained]. I have two years’ experience studying computer science, and therefore I am proficient with R, C++, Java, and Excel. In the future, I am interested in pursuing a quantitative analyst position in the financial industry.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/runlin/runlin.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
